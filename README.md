# MoreCrap
A terraria mod that basicly makes it so you can make tools out of every type of block in the game.
Right now I'm aiming on just making pickaxes, axes, and broadswords for every material/block that doesn't have one, although later I plan on creating every type of tool and weapon I can out of everything.
